# Introduction

- LLMs can be so huge that they're hard to run on consumer grade hardware.
- This course will teach
  - Different flavours of quantization
  - Different options and data types e.g. int8, float16 and pros and cons of these to make the right decisions for your use case.
  - Technical theory and algorithmic details of how to compress from 32 bit float to say 8 bit integer.
  - Dive deep into linear quantization by understanding how it works in practice.
  - Apply linear quantization into a text generation model using the Quanto library from Hugging Face.
